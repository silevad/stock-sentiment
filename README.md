In the world of investments, there are many things to take into consideration. Along with the normal metrics such as price and earnings, there are other factors that you need to make an informed decision, factors such as sentiments about a company. Sentiment is extremely hard to gauge as it's based on the news - and there exists a plethora of news sources. This tool aims to help with the noise and automatically assign a sentiment score and label based on news articles from selected, publicly available news articles and outlets.

# Description

Investing in the stock market can be tricky because there are many metrics to consider. Things like price, price-earnings ratios, alphas, price-to-book, and free cash flow are just a few of the factors to think about. There is also the qualitative data that comes from news sources. Data that can help you make investment decisions around a company's future value based on positive or negative news. To help you with these decisions, you can use the Watson Discovery pre-enriched news collection to keep track of various companies.
